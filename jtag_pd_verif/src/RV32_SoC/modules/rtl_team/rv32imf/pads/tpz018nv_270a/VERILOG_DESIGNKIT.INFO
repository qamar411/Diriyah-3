4) Special Notes

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   -- These notes are written for verilog model for TSMC core library
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------


   1. In this version , the negative time check that supported by the previous
      version has been removed. The reasons is that , although supporting  
      negative time check can describe the circuits more detail and realistic,
      however it maybe raise the difficulty and complexity of timing verification.  

   2. For that the SDF(v2.1) annotation didn't support removal time check, the 
      removal is replaced by using hold. 

   3. For the SDF annotation, this version has removed the negative timing check,
      these verilog models can support the older version verilog simulators and
      no more limited the simulatior must support the negative time check (Verilog-XL
      after v2.7 or NC-Verilog v2.1).

   4. Revising the conditions of timing check provides more concise constraints to
      improve the error coverage ,but these conditions may cause some unexpected 
      errors that never happen in the real case.
